## Notes (Nisha)

The route logic for the endpoints are incomplete at this time, so Iâ€™ve implemented mock/dummy tests using Jest to simulate functionality and ensure routes are properly tested. Tests are located in the backend -> tests directory.

## Misc. Notes, Not Vital (Nisha)

Had to switch port to 5001, was getting constant EADDRINUSE errors on nodemon w/ 5000. Tried the kill -9 process multiple times with no luck.
